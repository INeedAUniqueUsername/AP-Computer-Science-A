	Buggy1:
		public boolean isEmpty()
		The empty deck does have a size of 0, so isEmpty() must be where the error originates from.
	Buggy2:
		Card(String cardRank, String cardSuit, int cardPointValue)
		There is an error in the constructor.
	Buggy3:
		Deck(String[] arg0, String[] arg1, int[] arg2)
		The decks are not shuffled when they are instantiated
	Buggy4:
		Card Deck.deal()
		deal() returns null instead of the card at index 0
